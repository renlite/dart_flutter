## Renlite
is the try to develope a Flutter app only on the RenderObjectTree.

### Entry Point
Following the boot process of a Flutter Widget based app `void main() => runApp(MyApp());` I found out that at some point the class [`RenderingFlutterBinding`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderingFlutterBinding-class.html) was used to define the RenderObjectTree.

```Dart
class RenderingFlutterBinding extends BindingBase with GestureBinding, SchedulerBinding, ServicesBinding, SemanticsBinding, PaintingBinding, RendererBinding {
  /// Creates a binding for the rendering layer.
  ///
  /// The `root` render box is attached directly to the [renderView] and is
  /// given constraints that require it to fill the window.
  RenderingFlutterBinding({ RenderBox? root }) {
    assert(renderView != null);
    renderView.child = root;
  }
}
```
In the constructor you already can define the root node of your UI tree, which must be a subclass of [`AbstractNode > RenderObject > RenderBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderBox-class.html). There are a lot of implementers of [`AbstractNode > RenderObject > RenderBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderBox-class.html). If you compare the different names beginning with Render* you will see that a lot of Widgets - not beeing only composition Widgets - have a corresponding RenderObject doing the layout and painting.

The superclass constructor `BindingBase(){...}` is called implicitly when the incstance of RenderingFlutterBinding is created. In the [BindingBase's constructor](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/b22742018b/packages/flutter/lib/src/foundation/binding.dart#L45) there is especially the call `initInstances();` which invokes the overriden method in the [RendererBinding mixin](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RendererBinding-mixin.html). [RenderingFlutterBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderingFlutterBinding-class.html) uses [RendererBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RendererBinding-mixin.html) among other mixins.

```Dart
mixin RendererBinding on BindingBase, ServicesBinding, SchedulerBinding, GestureBinding, SemanticsBinding, HitTestable {
  @override
  void initInstances() {
    super.initInstances();
    _instance = this;
    _pipelineOwner = PipelineOwner(
      onNeedVisualUpdate: ensureVisualUpdate,
      onSemanticsOwnerCreated: _handleSemanticsOwnerCreated,
      onSemanticsOwnerDisposed: _handleSemanticsOwnerDisposed,
    );
    window
      ..onMetricsChanged = handleMetricsChanged
      ..onTextScaleFactorChanged = handleTextScaleFactorChanged
      ..onPlatformBrightnessChanged = handlePlatformBrightnessChanged
      ..onSemanticsEnabledChanged = _handleSemanticsEnabledChanged
      ..onSemanticsAction = _handleSemanticsAction;
    initRenderView();
    //...
  }

```
The [RendererBinding mixin](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RendererBinding-mixin.html) is the connection between the RenderObjectTree and the Flutter engine. The initialization of [PipelineOwner](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PipelineOwner-class.html) and of [RenderView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderView-class.html) is here of interest. 
* [PipelineOwner](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PipelineOwner-class.html) manages the rendering pipeline and the [RenderObjects](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html) that are visible on the screen. [PipelineOwner](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PipelineOwner-class.html) for example refreshes [RenderObjects](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html) marked as dirty. Every [RenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html) that is part of a render tree managed bei the [PipelineOwner](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PipelineOwner-class.html) holds a reference in the property `owner â†’ PipelineOwner?`. Only an attached [RenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html) is visible on the screen.
* [AbstractNode > RenderObject > RenderView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderView-class.html) is the root of the RenderObjectTree and handles bootstrapping of the render tree. It takes the entire size of a screen.
