## Renlite
is the try to develope a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) app only on the RenderObjectTree.

### Entry Point
Following the boot process of a Flutter Widget based app `void main() => runApp(MyApp());` I found out that at some point the class [`RenderingFlutterBinding`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderingFlutterBinding-class.html) was used to define the RenderObjectTree.

```Dart
class RenderingFlutterBinding extends BindingBase with GestureBinding, SchedulerBinding, ServicesBinding, SemanticsBinding, PaintingBinding, RendererBinding {
  /// Creates a binding for the rendering layer.
  ///
  /// The `root` render box is attached directly to the [renderView] and is
  /// given constraints that require it to fill the window.
  RenderingFlutterBinding({ RenderBox? root }) {
    assert(renderView != null);
    renderView.child = root;
  }
}
```
In the constructor you already can define the root node of your UI tree, which must be a subclass of [`AbstractNode > RenderObject > RenderBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderBox-class.html). There are a lot of implementers of [`AbstractNode > RenderObject > RenderBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderBox-class.html). If you compare the different names beginning with Render* you will see that a lot of Widgets - not beeing only composition Widgets - have a corresponding RenderObject doing the layout and painting.

The superclass constructor `BindingBase(){...}` is called implicitly when the incstance of RenderingFlutterBinding is created. In the [BindingBase's constructor](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/b22742018b/packages/flutter/lib/src/foundation/binding.dart#L45) there is especially the call `initInstances();` which invokes the overriden method in the [RendererBinding mixin](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RendererBinding-mixin.html). [RenderingFlutterBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderingFlutterBinding-class.html) uses [RendererBinding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RendererBinding-mixin.html) among other mixins.

```Dart
mixin RendererBinding on BindingBase, ServicesBinding, SchedulerBinding, GestureBinding, SemanticsBinding, HitTestable {
  @override
  void initInstances() {
    super.initInstances();
    _instance = this;
    _pipelineOwner = PipelineOwner(
      onNeedVisualUpdate: ensureVisualUpdate,
      onSemanticsOwnerCreated: _handleSemanticsOwnerCreated,
      onSemanticsOwnerDisposed: _handleSemanticsOwnerDisposed,
    );
    window
      ..onMetricsChanged = handleMetricsChanged
      ..onTextScaleFactorChanged = handleTextScaleFactorChanged
      ..onPlatformBrightnessChanged = handlePlatformBrightnessChanged
      ..onSemanticsEnabledChanged = _handleSemanticsEnabledChanged
      ..onSemanticsAction = _handleSemanticsAction;
    initRenderView();
    ...
  }

```
The [RendererBinding mixin](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RendererBinding-mixin.html) is the connection between the RenderObjectTree and the Flutter engine. The initialization of [PipelineOwner](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PipelineOwner-class.html) and of [RenderView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderView-class.html) is here of interest. After creation of the [PipelineOwner](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PipelineOwner-class.html) a [RenderView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderView-class.html) is initialized and assigned to the `_pipelineOwner.rootNode = value;` through the setter of `RenderView`.
```Dart
  /// Creates a [RenderView] object to be the root of the
  /// [RenderObject] rendering tree, and initializes it so that it
  /// will be rendered when the next frame is requested.
  void initRenderView() {
    ...
    renderView = RenderView(configuration: createViewConfiguration(), window: window);
    renderView.prepareInitialFrame();
  }
  ...
  /// The render tree that's attached to the output surface.
  RenderView get renderView => _pipelineOwner.rootNode! as RenderView;
  /// Sets the given [RenderView] object (which must not be null), and its tree, to
  /// be the new render tree to display. The previous tree, if any, is detached.
  set renderView(RenderView value) {
    assert(value != null);
    _pipelineOwner.rootNode = value;
  }
```
* [PipelineOwner](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PipelineOwner-class.html) manages the rendering pipeline and the [RenderObjects](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html) that are visible on the screen. [PipelineOwner](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PipelineOwner-class.html) for example maintains dirty states of [RenderObjects](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html) for layout, composition and painting. Every [RenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html) that is attached to a render tree managed by the [PipelineOwner](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/PipelineOwner-class.html) holds a reference in the property `owner â†’ PipelineOwner?`.  That means an attached [RenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html) can access the [RenderView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderView-class.html) instance, e.g. `final renderView = myRenderBox.owner.rootNode;`.
* [AbstractNode > RenderObject > RenderView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderView-class.html) is a special subclass of [RenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html). It is the root of the RenderObjectTree and handles bootstrapping of the render tree. It takes the entire size of a screen. 

### RenderTree Composition
There is no difference between composition of Widgets and RenderObjects. Dart offers the possibility to make composition of RenderObjects declarativly, so we can define the RenderTree and write the logic in one programming language.

With composition of Dart objects (Widgets, RenderObjects) we can create reuseable UI objects and design the UI for the screen. There are three main types of RenderObjects: Leaf, Container with one child or Container with more children. The following table shows samples of the association between RenderObjects and the Widgets. E.g. RawImage creates [RenderImage](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderImage-class.html) in the `RenderImage createRenderObject(BuildContext context) {...}` method and uses [RenderImage](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderImage-class.html) to show an image on screen.  

| RenderObject        | with Mixin                            | children  | related Widget   | extends                       |
| --------------------|---------------------------------------| ----------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| [RenderImage](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderImage-class.html)         |                                       | null      | [RawImage](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RawImage-class.html)         | [LeafRenderObjectWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LeafRenderObjectWidget-class.html)         |
| [RenderDecoratedBox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderDecoratedBox-class.html)  | [RenderObjectWithChildMixin](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObjectWithChildMixin-mixin.html)            | 0..1      | [DecoratedBox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/DecoratedBox-class.html)     | [SingleChildRenderObjectWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildRenderObjectWidget-class.html) |
| [RenderFlex](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderFlex-class.html)          | [ContainerRenderObjectMixin](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/ContainerRenderObjectMixin-mixin.html)            | 0..n      | [Flex](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Flex-class.html)             | [MultiChildRenderObjectWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MultiChildRenderObjectWidget-class.html)  |

The composition happens during the instantiation (constructor, setter for child property) of RenderObjects, but the attachment of a single RenderObject or a RenderTree to a PipelineOwner occurs later and only, if the parent RenderObject we expand is attached already. This is important because during composition there is no access to the instance of the PipelineOwner.   

### RenderTree Attachment
When is a RenderObject or a composition of RenderObjects transfered to a RenderTree? This happens the first time when a RenderObject or a Tree of RenderObjects is assigned to the [RenderView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderView-class.html). This can be when the instance of RenderingFlutterBinding is created and the root parameter is assigned.
```Dart
void main() {
  var app = AppService();
  RenderingFlutterBinding flutterBinding = RenderingFlutterBinding(
      root: RenderStack(
          children: [MasterService(app: app), Detail(app)],
          textDirection: TextDirection.ltr));
  flutterBinding.drawFrame();
}
```
Code from [renlite_sample_page] https://github.com/renlite/flutter/tree/master/renlite_sample_page.

The RenderView kicks off the walk down the RenderTree. As RenderView is a container RenderObject which can hold one child, it has a mixed in type [RenderObjectWithChildMixin<RenderBox>](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObjectWithChildMixin-mixin.html). Whith the assignement `RenderingFlutterBinding flutterBinding = RenderingFlutterBinding(root: RenderStack( ...` the child of RenderView is set to RenderDecoratedBox and the child setter of RenderView is called. Then `adoptChild(_child)` is invoked which is implemeented in the AbstractNode.

```Dart
class AbstractNode {
  // ...
  /// Whether this node is in a tree whose root is attached to something.
  ///
  /// This becomes true during the call to [attach].
  ///
  /// This becomes false during the call to [detach].
  bool get attached => _owner != null;
  
  @protected
  @mustCallSuper
  void adoptChild(covariant AbstractNode child) {
    // ...
    child._parent = this;
    if (attached)            // *** ONLY, if the parent ... the root of the RenderTree is attached too!!! ***
      child.attach(_owner!);
    redepthChild(child);
  }
}
  
abstract class RenderObject extends AbstractNode with DiagnosticableTreeMixin implements HitTestTarget {
  //..  
  @override
  void adoptChild(RenderObject child) {
    assert(_debugCanPerformMutations);
    assert(child != null);
    setupParentData(child);
    markNeedsLayout();
    markNeedsCompositingBitsUpdate();
    markNeedsSemanticsUpdate();
    super.adoptChild(child);
  }
}
```
Here the RenderView is assigned to be the child's parent and `child.attach(_owner!);` method (defined in RenderObjectWithChildMixin) is called, where `super.attach(owner);` of RenderObject and also `super.attach(owner);` of AbstractNode is invoked. In AbstractNode's attach method the PipelineOwner is finaly set to the child's (RenderDecoratedBox) owner property and the RenderObject's attach method marks the child as dirty. After all if the child (RenderDecoratedBox) itself has a child (RenderSizedOverflowBox), the RenderSizedOverflowBox' attach method will be called and so on till a leaf RenderObject has no child. 

```Dart
class AbstractNode {
  // ...
  @mustCallSuper
  void attach(covariant Object owner) {
    //..
    _owner = owner;
  }
}

abstract class RenderObject extends AbstractNode with DiagnosticableTreeMixin implements HitTestTarget {
  //..
  @override
  void attach(PipelineOwner owner) {
    super.attach(owner);
    // If the node was dirtied in some way while unattached, make sure to add
    // it to the appropriate dirty list now that an owner is available
    if (_needsLayout && _relayoutBoundary != null) {
      // Don't enter this block if we've never laid out at all;
      // scheduleInitialLayout() will handle it
      _needsLayout = false;
      markNeedsLayout();
    }
    if (_needsCompositingBitsUpdate) {
      _needsCompositingBitsUpdate = false;
      markNeedsCompositingBitsUpdate();
    }
    if (_needsPaint && _layer != null) {
      // Don't enter this block if we've never painted at all;
      // scheduleInitialPaint() will handle it
      _needsPaint = false;
      markNeedsPaint();
    }
    if (_needsSemanticsUpdate && _semanticsConfiguration.isSemanticBoundary) {
      // Don't enter this block if we've never updated semantics at all;
      // scheduleInitialSemantics() will handle it
      _needsSemanticsUpdate = false;
      markNeedsSemanticsUpdate();
    }
  }
}
  
mixin RenderObjectWithChildMixin<ChildType extends RenderObject> on RenderObject {
  // ...
  @override
  void attach(PipelineOwner owner) {
    super.attach(owner);
    if (_child != null)
      _child!.attach(owner);
  }
}
```
